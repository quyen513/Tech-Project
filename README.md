We will be building and testing an employee reimbursement system for Fantastic 4. We build the application from the ground up following Behavior Driven Development and Test Driven Development practices. We will build the UI and write the automation tests for it. We will be given high level user stories: You must break these down into smaller User Stories where necessary and then into Acceptance Criteria.
